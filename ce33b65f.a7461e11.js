This would ensure the grammatical correctness of the generated counterfactual example. Finally, the generation of counterfactual examples can have other applications than interpretability. In particular, it becomes possible to perform data augmentation in order to give more examples to a model. It can mitigate biases by balancing the sentiments of biased discriminated populations.
